JavaScript Course - Working with APIs

Use the browser's native fetch function with the giphy.com API to display a recommended gif targeted to the word or phrase entered into the API request URL.

## Usage

Enter a search term in the input field and click the "Search" button to retrieve and display a related GIF.

Click the "Alternate Image" button to fetch and display a different GIF related to the same search term (note: giphy's algorithm only provides a limited selection of images per query).
